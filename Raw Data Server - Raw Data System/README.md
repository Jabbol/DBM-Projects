## General Information    
This is the system that the Raw Data Server uses for their Raw data system.

## Important Information / Notes    

1. Before attempting to get support, please make sure that you have the following in BOTH your Bot Files as well as your DBM Files.
    - [x] [Beta Version of Discord Bot Maker](https://dbotmaker.io/forums/threads/how-to-join-the-beta-version-for-newbies-and-more.63/).
    - [x] [The Latest Beta Mods](https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods/tree/beta).
2. Be sure you are not downloading the files and putting them in the DBM Directory, but instead [Copying the data of each file into a new Command / Event](https://i.imgur.com/gDWVVXl.png).    
3. Change the following lines in the following actions:
    - `[Check] Raw Data Server` - Action #2 - Server ID
    - `[Check] Whitelist or Mod` - Action #2 - Role Name
    - `[Store] SQL Connection` - Action #1 - Connection Options
4. There may still be some issues/bugs that are being ironed out, if you see major issues with something. That is the ONLY time you are allowed to ping me.
5. You need a channel called `rd-deletion-logs`.
